# Hobkey


## Desc
Hobkey is a playground for messing around with kernel level things for me, a learning environment

## Build

### Prereq
(Follow the Limine Install guide)[https://github.com/limine-bootloader/limine#installing-limine-binaries]

### steps
Run:
`make` or `make all` to compile the binary kernel
then for quickstart run `make limine qemu` and it will run in qemu if installed


## Acknowledgments
As mentioned previously this uses the limine protocol and my image creation uses the limine bootloader, you can find those (here)[https://github.com/limine-bootloader/limine]
